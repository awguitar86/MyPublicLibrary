# MyPublicLibrary

To get the project started, first install the dependencies by running "npm install" in the root folder.

```npm install```

Then once those are installed run "npm start" in the root folder

```npm start```

After you have ran that, cd into the client folder and run "npm install" in there:

```npm install```

Then after all the dependecies for the fronend are installed, run "npm start" in the client folder

```npm start```

Once you have both the server and the client running, the client should open up the app in your browser and you can start looking at the books that My Public Library has. Enjoy!
